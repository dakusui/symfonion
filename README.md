# What is SyMFONION #
SyMFONION is a modern music macro language processor.

# How to run SyMFONION #

 java -jar  symfonion-VERSION.jar infile [outfile]

"infile" is a SyMFONION file and the syntax of it is described here [Syntax].
If "outfile" is not given, "infile" will be played.
If "outfile" is given, "infile" will be compiled and "outfile" is output in midi format.

The syntax of 'infile' is available here.

# Notes #
If you are using linux, I would recommend to use Sun's JDK/JRE. Not OpenJDK. Sun's Java plays music much nicer.
