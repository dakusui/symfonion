On the other hand, when you perform a live session before audience, you don't like to rely on such an auto-generation to avoid playing your musical piece on unintended devices.
Rather, you want to prepare this file and check (test) if the system is connected properly.


The value associated with an attribute `port` is a regular expression that matches a device name (link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/sound/midi/MidiDevice.Info.html#getName()[MidiDevice.Info#getName()]) that JVM gives.
In case it doesn't uniquely select a device, it will result in an error.
