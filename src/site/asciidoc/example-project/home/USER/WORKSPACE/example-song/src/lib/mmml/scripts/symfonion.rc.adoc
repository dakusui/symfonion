# A function that prints the specified bar
function bar() {
  local _bar_name="${1}"
  echo "$(ref ."${bars}"."${1}")"
}

# A function that prints the program change data.
# This is supposed to be called from inside an element in "$sequence" array.
function program_change() {
  local _program_name="${1}"
  local _device_name
  _device_name="${2:-$(device_name)}"

  # from the device name this function looks int `components/programs/{_device_name}.json,
  # which should hold an entry for the specified `_program_name`.
}

# This function is supposed to be called inside "$sequence" list element.
function device_name() {
  # this figures out port name first, then it will figure out a device name assigned to the port.
