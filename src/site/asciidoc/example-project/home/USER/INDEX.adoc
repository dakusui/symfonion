`mmml` is installed in XDG-based directory structure<<xdg-spec>>.
Since some important directories lack environment variables that point them in XDG standard, following labels are used in this documentation instead.

`XDG_LOCAL_LIB`:: This points `~/.local/lib`.
`XDG_LOCAL_BIN`:: This points `~/.local/bin`.


For instance, we may state that:

====
"Executables of `mmml` will be copied under directory `${XDG_LOCAL_LIB}/mmml/{mmml-version}`."
====

Also, there are following environment variables in XDG specification.

`XDG_DATA_HOME`:: This points `~/.share`.
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`:: This points `~/.config`.
