`port.json` defines a way to select a port to which midi messages should be sent.

  "port": "UM1"

The value associated with an attribute `port` is a regular expression that matches a device name (link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/sound/midi/MidiDevice.Info.html#getName()[MidiDevice.Info#getName()]) that JVM gives.
In case it doesn't uniquely select a device, it will result in an error.
