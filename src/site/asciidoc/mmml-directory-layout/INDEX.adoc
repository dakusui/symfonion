== The Processing Pipeline of MMML

include::mmml-pipeline.adoc[]

To render the documents under this directory properly, run `src/build_tools/init_asciidoc_attr.sh`, first.

Check: link:mmml-pipeline.adoc[MMML].

== File Name Convention of MMML

Under this directory, the documentation of the tool: MMML is stored.
Following is a convention of the file and directory names.

[%nowrap]
----
\_directory1   A directory.
  \_DIRECTORY2 A directory.
    .attr.adoc
  INDEX.adoc   .attr.adoc   An auto-genrated file that defines attribute values used in the documentation in common.
  INDEX.adoc   A documentation file that decribes this directory.
  file1.adoc   A documentation that describes `file1`.
  file2        An example of `file2`.
  FILE3.adoc   A documentation that describes a semantics which is named `FILE3`.
  __FUNCNAME__ Generates `__FUNCTIONE__.json`
----

In this documentation, concrete values as examples are used as much as possible to give a clear image to readers and readers can reuse fragments found in the documentation just by copy-and-pasting.
However, sometimes, authors want readers to realize that it is a responsibility of a user (=reader) to choose a name of a file.
For such files and directories, their name are written in CAPITAL in the directory structure.

In a documentation file (`.adoc` file), there will be a block which has an identifier `CONTENT`.
The block contains a concrete example of a file that the documentation describes.
In case just giving an example is sufficient, an example file is just placed. (Meaning, `file2` and `file2.adoc` should not co-exist in the same directory)

`.attr.adoc` is an auto-generated file that defines attributes referenced across documentation files.
Its contents look like following:

[%collapsible]
====
[%nowrap]
....
include::.attr.adoc[]
....
====

By doing `include::.attr.adoc[]` at the beginning of an `.adoc` file, we can reference an attribute `doc_base`, which specifies the directory that contains this file, for instance.

Also, in the "prepare resource" stage, when MMML finds a file `\\__FILENAME__` under a target directory, `\\__FILENAME__.json` will be generated.
A handler function whose name is `mmml_json_generator_FUNCNAME` and the output will be written to `\\__FILENAME__.json`.

Note that `\\__index__.json` is always generated for every directory under `target/mmml`.

== Attribute Name Convention of MMML

`$attribute_name`:: (t.b.d.)
`attribute_name`:: (t.b.d.)

== Future Works

(t.b.d.)
