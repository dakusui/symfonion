In this directory, system-specific configurations are stored.
For instance, which MIDI device is connected to which MIDI port is connected is a system specific configuration.
Such a configuration is stored under `json++` directory, which is a child of this directory, so that it can be referenced from user song files (`song.json{plus}{plus}`).
