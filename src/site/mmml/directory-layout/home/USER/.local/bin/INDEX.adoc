`mmml` 's installer does two things:

- It creates symbolic links under this directory, except for `mmml-manager`.
They are pointing executable files under `$+{XDG_LOCAL_LIB}+/mml/latest` of the same names.
- It copies `mmml-manager`, which is a tool to switch `mmml` versions.

The documentation of files under this directory are available under link:{xdg_local_lib}/mmml/1.0.1/INDEX.adoc[mmml/1.0.1] directory.
