Preset-D (GM Bank) 's program-2 "Piano 3" will be selected by this system exclusive message.

wave::
This is an attribute that specifies a "wave" of a voice.
In GM-1 (General MIDI 1) standard, it is just a program number that can be sent by `$program` control change.
Usually synthesizers have a lot of more tones not included in the standard.
To specify such a tone, you can send "bank" control change.
To select a bank, you can use `$bank` attribute.
Its integer part specifies MSB of it, while fraction part specifies LSB.
To find which bank stores what tones, check a manual of a synthesizer you are using.
Some mode of some synthesizer allows you to choose a tone through system exclusive messages.
For instance, a wave in an expansion card for Roland's JV series.
To choose it, you can use `$sysex` attribute.
