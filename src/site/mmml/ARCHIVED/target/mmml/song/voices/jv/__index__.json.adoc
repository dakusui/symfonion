From the content of `guitar.json` and `piano.json`, this file is auto-generated.
This file is then integrated in link:../voices.json.adoc[voices.json].

The `$channel` (the first argument of the `$jv-set-patchnum-pr-d` function) is required to place here to specify the MIDI channel where the program is changed.
This is because system exclusive message is not belonging to any channel, essentially.
The value is automatically resolved at the compilation-time of `symfonion` to the channel where the `$sysex` expression eventually appears inside `$sequence` attribute array.

NOTE:: By defining function inside which it references the `$channel` variable, we can remove this boilerplate, but it's a minor detail and possible future improvement.
